# OptixTools

### What is it?

- A system to easily track the usage and location of tools
- It will have a sign out system so team members will have to sign out tools in order to use them
- There will be a sign up system so that team members can only use a tool for however long they signed it out

### Why do we need it?

- So that build will stop arguing and just get on with making the robot so that we can actually have time to program and test it and not have to deal with them/build it ourselves

- A system to easily track and order robot parts
- It be able to scrape common robotics and shipping sites for tracking information
